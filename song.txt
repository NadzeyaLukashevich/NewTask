I'm not strong enough to stay away
I can't run from you
I just run back to you
Like a moth, I'm drawn into your flame
You say my name
But it's not the same
You look in my eyes
I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders
And you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave, and I wanna stay
And I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do?
I would die without you
In your presence my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame
'Cause you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave, and I wanna stay
And I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away


There's nothing I can do
My heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love's done to me
And it's killing me when you're away
And I wanna leave, and I wanna stay
And I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away (not strong enough, strong enough)
To stay away (not strong enough, strong enough)
(Not strong enough, strong enough)
And I'm not strong enough to stay away
